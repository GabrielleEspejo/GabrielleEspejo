- 👋 Hi, I’m @GabrielleEspejo Gaby 😉
- 👀 I’m interested in the IT world and everything we can achieve by doing it. I like photography.
I am passionate about cooking and gardening. I listen to Daft Punk and occasionally Rosalia, also some cracks guys from Costa Rica 
Niño Koi. And if I were a writer I would have a better bio, that is why coding is better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React with SheCodes IO and Software testing with Udemy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects in which I can prove my skills and earn more experience.
- 📫 How to reach me https://www.linkedin.com/in/mar%C3%ADa-gabrielle-espejo-2b1aa320a/
